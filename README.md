## Architecture
ecom-microservices follows a microservices architecture, a proven approach for creating scalable, maintainable, and loosely coupled systems. Each microservice serves a specific function, can be independently developed and deployed, and communicates with other microservices via APIs. This architecture offers flexibility and modularity for your e-commerce solution.

## Features
The ecom-microservices project offers a wide range of features that empower your e-commerce platform:

- **Product Catalog Service:** Manages product information, including name, description, price, and availability. Easily add, update, or remove products.
- **Order Service:** Handles order creation, processing, and tracking. Provides real-time order status updates for customers and administrators.
- **User Service:** Manages user authentication, authorization, and profile information. Securely handle customer accounts and access control.
- **Payment Service:** Integrates with popular payment gateways to facilitate secure transactions. Supports various payment methods and currencies.
- **Shipping Service:** Manages the shipment and delivery of orders. Calculate shipping costs, track packages, and ensure on-time delivery.
- **Notification Service:** Sends notifications to users, including order confirmation, shipment updates, and promotions. Easily customize notification content.
